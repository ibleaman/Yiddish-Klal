# Yiddish Klal Ligatur
A Standard Yiddish keyboard layout for Mac OS by Isaac L. Bleaman

This layout uses precombined Unicode ligature characters (e.g., ямо) to represent any character with diacritics. If you do not need this feature, Yiddish Klal (without Ligatur) is recommended instead.

The keyboard layout bundle that needs to be dragged into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` is compressed in the .zip file. Unzip that file, drag it over, and you're ready to enable the layout under System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources.

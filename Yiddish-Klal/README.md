# Yiddish Klal
A Standard Yiddish keyboard layout for Mac OS by Isaac L. Bleaman

The keyboard layout bundle that needs to be dragged into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` is compressed in the .zip file. Unzip that file, drag it over, and you're ready to enable the layout under System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources.
